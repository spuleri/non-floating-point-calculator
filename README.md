Compilation
	A makefile has been included in the directory. It utilizes the g++ compiler. It is based on C++ 98.
	The makefile creates "Project.exe".
	To run, enter "./Project".
	To run in file-input mode, enter "./Project file filename.txt". More information on file-input mode
	is below.

File-Input Mode
	A .txt file can be used to evalulate expressions. The file must be in the same directory as the
	source and must not contain spaces in its name. Each expression should be entered as would be on the
	calculator (with required spacing, etc.). Separate multiple expressions with a single line break. A
	single line must be at the end of the file. If there are issues with the last character being
	truncated, insert a space after each expression (this is a text editor issue). 
	
	The source directory contains an example file. The contents and name can both be changed, as long as
	the format requirments are met.
